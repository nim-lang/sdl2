#   In order to use these functions, SDL_Init() must have been called
#   with the ::SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK flag.  This causes SDL to scan the system
#   for game controllers, and load appropriate drivers.
#
#   If you would like to receive controller updates while the application
#   is in the background, you should set the following hint before calling
#   SDL_Init(): SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_ALLOW_BACKGROUND_EVENTS

#
#  Using the SDL_HINT_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG hint or the SDL_GameControllerAddMapping you can add support for controllers SDL is unaware of or cause an existing controller to have a different binding. The format is:
#  guid,name,mappings
#
#  Where GUID is the string value from SDL_JoystickGetGUIDString(), name is the human readable string for the device and mappings are controller mappings to joystick ones.
#  Under Windows there is a reserved GUID of "xinput" that covers any XInput devices.
#  The mapping format for joystick is:
#      bX - a joystick button, index X
#      hX.Y - hat X with value Y
#      aX - axis X of the joystick
#  Buttons can be used as a controller axis and vice versa.
