  importc: "SDL_OpenAudio".}
  ## This procedure opens the audio device with the desired parameters, and

  ## object pointed to by `obtained`.  If `obtained` is `nil`, the audio
  ## data passed to the callback procedure will be guaranteed to be in the
  ## requested format, and will be automatically converted to the hardware
  ## audio format if necessary.  This procedure returns `-1` if it failed
  ## to open the audio device, or couldn't set up the audio thread.
  ##
  ## When filling in the `desired` audio spec object,
  ## * `desired.freq` should be the desired audio frequency
  ##   in samples-per- second.
  ## * `desired.format` should be the desired audio format.
  ## * `desired.samples` is the desired size of the audio buffer,
  ##   in samples.  This number should be a power of two, and may be adjusted
  ##   by the audio driver to a value more suitable for the hardware.
  ##   Good values seem to range between `512` and `8096` inclusive, depending
  ##   on the  application and CPU speed.  Smaller values yield faster
  ##   response time, but can lead to underflow if the application is doing
  ##   heavy processing and cannot fill the audio buffer in time.  A stereo
  ##   sample consists of both right and left channels in LR ordering.
  ##
  ##   Note that the number of samples is directly related to time by the
  ##   following formula:
  ##
  ##   `ms = (samples*1000)/freq`
  ##
  ## * `desired.size` is the size in bytes of the audio buffer, and is
  ##   calculated by `openAudio()`.
  ## * `desired.silence` is the value used to set the buffer to silence,
  ##   and is calculated by `openAudio()`.
  ## * `desired.callback` should be set to a procedure that will be called
  ##   when the audio device is ready for more data.  It is passed a pointer
  ##   to the audio buffer, and the length in bytes of the audio buffer.
  ##   This procedure usually runs in a separate thread, and so you should
  ##   protect data structures that it accesses by calling `lockAudio()`
  ##   and `unlockAudio()` in your code. Alternately, you may pass a `nil`
  ##   pointer here, and call `queueAudio()` with some frequency, to queue
  ##   more audio samples to be played (or for capture devices, call
  ##   `sdl.dequeueAudio()` with some frequency, to obtain audio samples).
  ## * `desired.userdata` is passed as the first parameter to your callback
  ##   procedure. If you passed a `nil` callback, this value is ignored.
  ##
  ## The audio device starts out playing silence when it's opened, and should
  ## be enabled for playing by calling `pauseAudio(0)` when you are ready
  ## for your audio callback procedure to be called.  Since the audio driver
  ## may modify the requested size of the audio buffer, you should allocate
  ## any local mixing buffers after you open the audio device.

  ##
  ## There are no limits on the amount of data you can queue, short of
  ## exhaustion of address space. Data from the device will keep queuing as
  ## necessary without further intervention from you. This means you will
  ## eventually run out of memory if you aren't routinely dequeueing data.
  ##
  ## Capture devices will not queue data when paused; if you are expecting
  ## to not need captured audio for some length of time, use

  ## Load the audio data of a WAVE file into memory.
  ##
  ## Loading a WAVE file requires `src`, `spec`, `audio_buf` and
  ## `audio_len` to be valid pointers. The entire data portion of the file
  ## is then loaded into memory and decoded if necessary.
  ##
  ## If `freesrc` is non-zero, the data source gets automatically closed and
  ## freed before the procedure returns.
  ##
  ## Supported are RIFF WAVE files with the formats PCM
  ## (8, 16, 24, and 32 bits), IEEE Float (32 bits), Microsoft ADPCM and IMA
  ## ADPCM (4 bits), and A-law and µ-law (8 bits). Other formats are currently
  ## unsupported and cause an error.
  ##
  ## If this procedure succeeds, the pointer returned by it is equal to
  ## `spec` and the pointer to the audio data allocated by the procedure is
  ## written to `audio_buf` and its length in bytes to `audio_len`.
  ## The `sdl.AudioSpec` members `freq`, `channels`, and `format` are
  ## set to the values of the audio data in the buffer. The `samples` member
  ## is set to a sane default and all others are set to zero.
  ##
  ## It's necessary to use `sdl.freeWAV()` to free the audio data returned
  ## in `audio_buf` when it is no longer used.
  ##
  ## Because of the underspecification of the Waveform format, there are many
  ## problematic files in the wild that cause issues with strict decoders. To
  ## provide compatibility with these files, this decoder is lenient in regards
  ## to the truncation of the file, the fact chunk, and the size of the RIFF
  ## chunk. The hints `sdl.HINT_WAVE_RIFF_CHUNK_SIZE`,
  ## `sdl.HINT_WAVE_TRUNCATION`, and `sdl.HINT_WAVE_FACT_CHUNK`
  ## can be used to tune the behavior of the loading process.
  ##
  ## Any file that is invalid (due to truncation, corruption, or wrong values
  ## in the headers), too big, or unsupported causes an error. Additionally,
  ## any critical I/O error from the data source will terminate the loading
  ## process with an error. The procedure returns `nil` on error and in all
  ## cases (with the exception of `src` being `nil`), an appropriate error
  ## message will be set.
  ##
  ## It is required that the data source supports seeking.
  ##
  ## Example:
  ##
  ## .. code-block:: nim
  ##   sdl.loadWAV_RW(sdl.rwFromFile("sample.wav", "rb"), 1, ...)
  ##
  ## `src` The data source with the WAVE data
  ##
  ## `freesrc` A integer value that makes the procedure close the data source
  ## if non-zero
  ##
  ## `spec` A pointer filled with the audio format of the audio data
  ##
  ## `audio_buf` A pointer filled with the audio data allocated by the
  ## procedure
  ##
  ## `audio_len` A pointer filled with the length of the audio data buffer
  ## in bytes
  ##
  ## `Return` `nil` on error, or non-`nil` on success.

  ##
  ## The data conversion may expand the size of the audio data, so the buffer
  ## `cvt.buf` should be allocated after the `cvt` object is initialized
  ## by `buildAudioCVT()`, and should be `cvt.len*cvt.len_mult` bytes long.
  ##
  ## `Return` `0` on success or `-1` if `cvt.buf` is `nil`.
