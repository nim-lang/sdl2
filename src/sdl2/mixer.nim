const
  MIX_CHANNEL_POST* = - 2

# This is the format of a special effect callback:
#
#    myeffect(int chan, void *stream, int len, void *udata);
#
#  (chan) is the channel number that your effect is affecting. (stream) is
#   the buffer of data to work upon. (len) is the size of (stream), and
#   (udata) is a user-defined bit of data, which you pass as the last arg of
#   Mix_RegisterEffect(), and is passed back unmolested to your callback.
#   Your effect changes the contents of (stream) based on whatever parameters
#   are significant, or just leaves it be, if you prefer. You can do whatever
#   you like to the buffer, though, and it will continue in its changed state
#   down the mixing pipeline, through any other effect functions, then finally
#   to be mixed with the rest of the channels and music for the final output
#   stream.
#
#  DO NOT EVER call SDL_LockAudio() from your callback function!
#

type
  Mix_EffectFunc_t* = proc (chan: cint; stream: pointer; len: cint;
                            udata: pointer) {.cdecl.}

#
#  This is a callback that signifies that a channel has finished all its
#   loops and has completed playback. This gets called if the buffer
#   plays out normally, or if you call Mix_HaltChannel(), implicitly stop
#   a channel via Mix_AllocateChannels(), or unregister a callback while
#   it's still playing.
#
#  DO NOT EVER call SDL_LockAudio() from your callback function!
#

type
  Mix_EffectDone_t* = proc (chan: cint; udata: pointer) {.cdecl.}

# Register a special effect function. At mixing time, the channel data is
#   copied into a buffer and passed through each registered effect function.
#   After it passes through all the functions, it is mixed into the final
#   output stream. The copy to buffer is performed once, then each effect
#   function performs on the output of the previous effect. Understand that
#   this extra copy to a buffer is not performed if there are no effects
#   registered for a given chunk, which saves CPU cycles, and any given
#   effect will be extra cycles, too, so it is crucial that your code run
#   fast. Also note that the data that your function is given is in the
#   format of the sound device, and not the format you gave to Mix_OpenAudio(),
#   although they may in reality be the same. This is an unfortunate but
#   necessary speed concern. Use Mix_QuerySpec() to determine if you can
#   handle the data before you register your effect, and take appropriate
#   actions.
#  You may also specify a callback (Mix_EffectDone_t) that is called when
#   the channel finishes playing. This gives you a more fine-grained control
#   than Mix_ChannelFinished(), in case you need to free effect-specific
#   resources, etc. If you don't need this, you can specify NULL.
#  You may set the callbacks before or after calling Mix_PlayChannel().
#  Things like Mix_SetPanning() are just internal special effect functions,
#   so if you are using that, you've already incurred the overhead of a copy
#   to a separate buffer, and that these effects will be in the queue with
#   any functions you've registered. The list of registered effects for a
#   channel is reset when a chunk finishes playing, so you need to explicitly
#   set them with each call to Mix_PlayChannel*().
#  You may also register a special effect function that is to be run after
#   final mixing occurs. The rules for these callbacks are identical to those
#   in Mix_RegisterEffect, but they are run after all the channels and the
#   music have been mixed into a single stream, whereas channel-specific
#   effects run on a given channel before any other mixing occurs. These
#   global effect callbacks are call "posteffects". Posteffects only have
#   their Mix_EffectDone_t function called when they are unregistered (since
#   the main output stream is never "done" in the same sense as a channel).
#   You must unregister them manually when you've had enough. Your callback
#   will be told that the channel being mixed is (MIX_CHANNEL_POST) if the
#   processing is considered a posteffect.
#
#  After all these effects have finished processing, the callback registered
#   through Mix_SetPostMix() runs, and then the stream goes to the audio
#   device.
#
#  DO NOT EVER call SDL_LockAudio() from your callback function!

# You may not need to call this explicitly, unless you need to stop an
#   effect from processing in the middle of a chunk's playback.

#   this will also shut off some internal effect processing, since

#   called internally when a channel completes playback.

const
  MIX_EFFECTSMAXSPEED* = "MIX_EFFECTSMAXSPEED"

#
#  These are the internally-defined mixing effects. They use the same API that
#   effects defined in the application use, but are provided here as a
#   convenience. Some effects can reduce their quality or use more memory in
#   the name of speed; to enable this, make sure the environment variable
#   MIX_EFFECTSMAXSPEED (see above) is defined before you call
#   Mix_OpenAudio().
#
# Set the panning of a channel. The left and right channels are specified
#   as integers between 0 and 255, quietest to loudest, respectively.
#
#  Technically, this is just individual volume control for a sample with
#   two (stereo) channels, so it can be used for more than just panning.
#   If you want real panning, call it like this:
#
#    Mix_SetPanning(channel, left, 255 - left);
#
#  ...which isn't so hard.
#
#  Setting (channel) to MIX_CHANNEL_POST registers this as a posteffect, and
#   the panning will be done to the final mixed stream before passing it on
#   to the audio device.
#
#  This uses the Mix_RegisterEffect() API internally, and returns without
#   registering the effect function if the audio device is not configured
#   for stereo output. Setting both (left) and (right) to 255 causes this
#   effect to be unregistered, since that is the data's normal state.
#
#  returns zero if error (no such channel or Mix_RegisterEffect() fails),
#   nonzero if panning effect enabled. Note that an audio device in mono
#   mode is a no-op, but this call will return successful in that case.
#   Error messages can be retrieved from Mix_GetError().
#

proc setPanning*(channel: cint; left: uint8; right: uint8): cint {.importc: "Mix_SetPanning".}
# Set the position of a channel. (angle) is an integer from 0 to 360, that
#   specifies the location of the sound in relation to the listener. (angle)
#   will be reduced as neccesary (540 becomes 180 degrees, -100 becomes 260).
#   Angle 0 is due north, and rotates clockwise as the value increases.
#   For efficiency, the precision of this effect may be limited (angles 1
#   through 7 might all produce the same effect, 8 through 15 are equal, etc).
#   (distance) is an integer between 0 and 255 that specifies the space
#   between the sound and the listener. The larger the number, the further
#   away the sound is. Using 255 does not guarantee that the channel will be
#   culled from the mixing process or be completely silent. For efficiency,
#   the precision of this effect may be limited (distance 0 through 5 might
#   all produce the same effect, 6 through 10 are equal, etc). Setting (angle)
#   and (distance) to 0 unregisters this effect, since the data would be
#   unchanged.
#
#  If you need more precise positional audio, consider using OpenAL for
#   spatialized effects instead of SDL_mixer. This is only meant to be a
#   basic effect for simple "3D" games.
#
#  If the audio device is configured for mono output, then you won't get
#   any effectiveness from the angle; however, distance attenuation on the
#   channel will still occur. While this effect will function with stereo
#   voices, it makes more sense to use voices with only one channel of sound,
#   so when they are mixed through this effect, the positioning will sound
#   correct. You can convert them to mono through SDL before giving them to
#   the mixer in the first place if you like.
#
#  Setting (channel) to MIX_CHANNEL_POST registers this as a posteffect, and
#   the positioning will be done to the final mixed stream before passing it
#   on to the audio device.
#
#  This is a convenience wrapper over Mix_SetDistance() and Mix_SetPanning().
#
#  returns zero if error (no such channel or Mix_RegisterEffect() fails),
#   nonzero if position effect is enabled.
#   Error messages can be retrieved from Mix_GetError().

# Set the "distance" of a channel. (distance) is an integer from 0 to 255
#   that specifies the location of the sound in relation to the listener.
#   Distance 0 is overlapping the listener, and 255 is as far away as possible
#   A distance of 255 does not guarantee silence; in such a case, you might
#   want to try changing the chunk's volume, or just cull the sample from the
#   mixing process with Mix_HaltChannel().
#  For efficiency, the precision of this effect may be limited (distances 1
