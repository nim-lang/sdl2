## Include file for SDL joystick event handling
##
## The term "device_index" identifies currently plugged in joystick devices
## between 0 and SDL_NumJoysticks, with the exact joystick behind a 
## device_index changing as joysticks are plugged and unplugged.
##
## The term "instance_id" is the current instantiation of a joystick device in
## the system, if the joystick is removed and then re-inserted then it will get
## a new instance_id, instance_id's are monotonically increasing identifiers of
## a joystick plugged in.
##
## The term JoystickGUID is a stable 128-bit identifier for a joystick device
## that does not change over time, it identifies class of the device 
## (a X360 wired controller for example). This identifier is platform dependent.
##
## In order to use these functions, `init()` must have been called with
## the `INIT_JOYSTICK` flag. This causes SDL to scan the system for joysticks,
## and load appropriate drivers.
##
## If you would like to receive joystick updates while the application
## is in the background, you should set the following hint before calling
## `init()`: `SDL_HINT_JOYSTICK_ALLOW_BACKGROUND_EVENTS`

    ## This is a unique ID for a joystick for the time it is connected to the
    ## system, and is never reused for the lifetime of the application. If the
    ## joystick is disconnected and reconnected, it will get a new ID.
    ##
    ## The ID value starts at `0` and increments from there.
    ## The value `-1` is an invalid ID.
