## Network Byte Order
## ------------------
## Also known as `Big-Endian`. Which means the most significant byte comes
## first in storage. Sparc and Motorola 68k based chips are MSB ordered.
##
## `Little-Endian` (LSB) is stored in the opposite order, with the least
## significant byte first in memory. Intel and AMD are two LSB machines.
##
## For network addresses, 1.2.3.4 is always stored as `{0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04}`.

# IPv4 hostname resolution API
#*********************************************************************

proc resolveHost*(address: ptr IpAddress; host: cstring; port: uint16): cint {.
  importc: "SDLNet_ResolveHost".}
  ## Resolve a host name and port to an IP address in network form.
  ##
  ## `address` points to the `IPaddress` that will be filled in.
  ## It doesn't need to be set before calling this,
  ## but it must be allocated in memory.
  ##
  ## `host` For connecting to a server, this is the hostname or IP
  ## in a string.
  ##
  ## For becoming a server, this is `nil`.
  ##
  ## If you do use `nil`, all network interfaces would be listened to for
  ## incoming connections, using the `INADDR_ANY` address.
  ##
  ## `port` For connecting to a server, this is the the servers listening
  ## port number.
  ##
  ## For becoming a server, this is the port to listen on.
  ##
  ## If you are just doing Domain Name Resolution functions, this can be `0`.
  ##
  ## Resolve the string `host`, and fill in the `IPaddress` pointed to by
  ## `address` with the resolved IP and the port number passed in through
  ## `port`.
  ##
  ## This is the best way to fill in the `IPaddress` struct for later use.
  ## This procedure does not actually open any sockets, it is used to prepare
  ## the arguments for the socket opening procedures.
  ##
  ## `WARNING:` this procedure will put the `host` and `port`
  ## into Network Byte Order into the `address` fields, so make sure
  ## you pass in the data in your hosts byte order (normally not an issue).
  ##
  ## `Return` `0` on success. `-1` on errors,
  ## plus `address.host` will be `INADDR_NONE`.
  ## An error would likely be that the address could not be resolved.
  ##
  ## For a server listening on all interfaces, on port 1234:
  ##
  ## .. code-block:: nim
  ##   # create a server type IPaddress on port 1234
  ##   var ipaddress: IPaddress
  ##   net.resolveHost(addr(ipaddress), nil, 1234)
  ##
  ## For a client connection to "host.domain.ext", at port 1234:
  ##
  ## .. code-block:: nim
  ##   # create an IPaddress for host name "host.domain.ext" on port 1234
  ##   # this is used by a client
  ##   var ipaddress: IPaddress
  ##   net.resolveHost(addr(ipaddress), "host.domain.ext", 1234)

proc resolveIP*(ip: ptr IpAddress): cstring {.importc: "SDLNet_ResolveIP".}
  ## Resolve an ip address to a host name in canonical form.
  ##
  ## `address` points to the `IPaddress` that will be resolved
  ## to a host name. The `address.port` is ignored.
  ##
  ## Resolve the IPv4 numeric address in `address.host`,
  ## and return the hostname as a string.
  ##
  ## `Note` that this procedure is not thread-safe.
  ##
  ## `Return` a valid char pointer (`cstring`) on success.
  ## The returned hostname will have host and domain, as in "host.domain.ext".
  ## `nil` is returned on errors, such as when it's not able to resolve
  ## the host name. The returned pointer is not to be freed.
  ## Each time you call this procedure the previous pointer's data will change
  ## to the new value, so you may have to copy it into a local buffer to keep
  ## it around longer.

proc getLocalAddresses*(addresses: ptr IpAddress; maxcount: cint): cint {.
  importc: "SDLNet_GetLocalAddresses".}
  ## Get the addresses of network interfaces on this system.
  ##
  ## `Return` the number of addresses saved in `addresses`.

# TCP network API
#*********************************************************************

proc tcpOpen*(ip: ptr IpAddress): TcpSocket {.importc: "SDLNet_TCP_Open".}
  ## Open a TCP network socket.
  ##
  ## `ip` This points to the `IPaddress` that contains the resolved
  ## IP address and port number to use.
  ##
  ## If `ip.host` is `INADDR_NONE` or `INADDR_ANY`, this creates a local
  ## server socket on the given port, otherwise a TCP connection to the
  ## remote host and port is attempted. The address passed in should already
  ## be swapped to network byte order (addresses returned from
  ## `resolveHost()` are already in the correct form).
  ##
  ## `Return` a valid `TCPsocket` on success, which indicates a successful
  ## connection has been established, or a socket has been created that is
  ## valid to accept incoming TCP connections.
  ## `nil` is returned on errors, such as when it's not able to create
  ## a socket, or it cannot connect to host and/or port contained in ip.

  ##
  ## `server` This is the server `TCPsocket` which was previously created

  ## Do not use this procedure on a connected socket. Server sockets are never
  ## connected to a remote host. What you get back is a new `TCPsocket` that

  ## accepted, you will get a `nil` `TCPsocket` and the program will

  ## connection has been established. `nil` is returned on errors, such as
  ## when it's not able to create a socket, or it cannot finish connecting to
  ## the originating host and port. There also may not be a connection attempt
  ## in progress, so of course you cannot accept nothing, and you get a `nil`

  ## You may have to read 1 byte at a time for some applications, for instance,

  ## Open a UDP network socket.

  ## `port` This is the port number (in native byte order) on which to
  ## receive UDP packets. Most servers will want to use a known port number
  ## here so that clients can easily communicate with the server.
  ## This can also be zero, which then opens an anonymous unused port number,
  ## to most likely be used to send UDP packets from.
  ## The `port` should be given in native byte order, but is used
  ## internally in network (big endian) byte order, in addresses, etc.
  ## This allows other systems to send to this socket via a known port.
  ##
  ## Open a socket to be used for UDP packet sending and/or receiving.
  ## If a non-zero port is given it will be used, otherwise any open port
  ## number will be used automatically.
  ##
  ## Unlike TCP sockets, this socket does not require a remote host IP to
  ## connect to, this is because UDP ports are never actually connected like
  ## TCP ports are. This socket is able to send and receive directly after
  ## this simple creation.
  ##
  ## `Note` that below I say server, but clients may also open a specific
  ## port, though it is prefered that a client be more flexible, given that
  ## the port may be already allocated by another process, such as a server.
  ## In such a case you will not be able to open the socket, and your program
  ## will be stuck, so it is better to just use whatever port you are given by
  ## using a specified port of zero. Then the client will always work.
  ## The client can inform the server what port to talk back to, or the server
  ## can just look at the source of the packets it is receiving to know where
  ## to respond to.
